- Understand Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).
- Consider their advantages, limitations, and use cases.

### 3. **Permissioned vs. Permissionless Blockchains**

- Compare private (permissioned) and public (permissionless) blockchains.
- Discuss scenarios where each type is suitable.
- Explore Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, and Quorum for permissioned blockchains.

### 4. **Interoperability Solutions**

- Address the challenge of interoperability between different blockchains.
- Look into projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink.
- Understand cross-chain communication and bridging.
